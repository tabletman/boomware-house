# Visual Prompt for AI Image Generation

## BoomWare House v2 - Autonomous Multi-Platform Listing Swarm

### System Architecture Visualization Prompt

```
Create a modern, clean technical architecture diagram showing an autonomous marketplace automation system with the following elements:

CENTRAL WORKFLOW (left to right):
1. CAMERA/PHONE capturing product photos
2. AI VISION AGENT (represented by an eye icon with neural network) analyzing images
3. DATABASE (cylinder icon) storing inventory with SQLite logo
4. SWARM OF LISTING AGENTS (5 robot icons) working in parallel
5. MARKETPLACE PLATFORMS (5 platform logos: eBay, Facebook, Mercari, Poshmark, OfferUp) receiving listings

DETAILED COMPONENTS:

TOP SECTION - "INPUT":
- Smartphone/camera icon taking photos of products (shoes, electronics, clothing)
- Images flowing into a funnel labeled "Image Processor"
- Background removal and enhancement visualization

MIDDLE SECTION - "ANALYSIS & INTELLIGENCE":
- Claude Vision API icon (Anthropic logo) analyzing products
- Market Intelligence robot scanning competitor prices with magnifying glass
- Price Optimizer robot with calculator and dollar signs
- All connected to central SQLite database (glowing cylinder)

BOTTOM SECTION - "AUTONOMOUS LISTING EXECUTION":
- 5 specialized robot agents (each with different tools):
  * eBay Agent (API connection, lightning bolt)
  * Facebook Agent (browser automation, Chrome icon)
  * Mercari Agent (browser automation)
  * Poshmark Agent (browser automation)
  * OfferUp Agent (browser automation)
- Each agent has a checkmark showing "POSTED" status
- Inventory Manager robot overseeing all agents with clipboard

DATA FLOW VISUALIZATION:
- Blue arrows showing image upload flow
- Green arrows showing successful listings
- Orange arrows showing price data feedback
- Purple arrows showing performance metrics

CURRENT PHASE HIGHLIGHT (Phase 1):
- Database cylinder glowing with "COMPLETE ✓" badge
- Schema visualization showing 5 interconnected tables
- Performance metrics dashboard in corner

STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Modern, flat design with soft shadows
- Color scheme: Blue (#2563EB) for primary, Green (#10B981) for success, Orange (#F59E0B) for data
- Isometric or 2.5D perspective
- Clean icons, minimal text
- Professional tech startup aesthetic
- White/light gray background
- Subtle grid pattern suggesting automation/precision

MOOD:
- Efficient, automated, intelligent
- Multi-agent coordination
- Seamless cross-platform integration
- Data-driven decision making

TEXT OVERLAYS:
- Title: "BoomWare House v2"
- Subtitle: "Autonomous Multi-Platform Listing Swarm"
- Phase indicator: "Phase 1: Database Foundation ✓"
- Small stats overlay: "5 Platforms • AI Vision • Smart Pricing • Automated Listing"
```

### Alternative Simplified Prompt

```
Technical diagram of an AI-powered marketplace automation system:
- Left side: smartphone camera taking product photos
- Center: AI brain analyzing images, connected to SQLite database
- Right side: 5 robot agents simultaneously posting to eBay, Facebook, Mercari, Poshmark, and OfferUp
- Visual style: modern flat design, blue and green color scheme, isometric perspective
- Show data flowing from camera → AI analysis → database → multiple marketplace platforms
- Include visual elements: neural network patterns, database tables, API connections, browser automation icons
- Label "Phase 1 Complete: Database Foundation"
```

### Key Visual Elements to Include

1. **Product Photography Input**
   - Camera/phone icon
   - Sample product images (shoes, electronics, etc.)
   - Image enhancement indicators

2. **AI Analysis Layer**
   - Claude/Anthropic logo or neural network visualization
   - Computer vision analyzing product features
   - Price intelligence scanning competitor listings

3. **Database Core**
   - Glowing SQLite database cylinder
   - Visual representation of 5 tables (inventory, listings, price_history, agent_logs, performance_metrics)
   - Data relationships shown as connecting lines

4. **Agent Swarm**
   - 5 distinct robot agents (one per platform)
   - Each with unique characteristics:
     * eBay: Official API connection (lightning bolt)
     * Facebook: Browser automation (Chrome icon)
     * Mercari: Browser automation
     * Poshmark: Fashion-focused styling
     * OfferUp: Local marketplace icon

5. **Marketplace Platforms**
   - Actual platform logos or stylized versions
   - Success indicators (checkmarks, green glow)
   - Active listings shown as cards

6. **Data Flow Arrows**
   - Color-coded by function:
     * Blue: Image/product data
     * Green: Successful operations
     * Orange: Pricing/market data
     * Purple: Analytics/metrics

7. **Performance Dashboard**
   - Small corner widget showing:
     * Items tracked
     * Listings posted
     * Sales completed
     * Platform performance

### Implementation Notes

This visualization should communicate:
- **Automation**: System works autonomously without manual intervention
- **Intelligence**: AI-powered analysis and pricing
- **Scale**: Handles multiple platforms simultaneously
- **Reliability**: Database foundation ensures data integrity
- **Efficiency**: Parallel agent execution, not sequential

The goal is to show a sophisticated, production-ready marketplace automation system that transforms product photos into live listings across 5 platforms automatically.
